# p01-rust-view-sqlite-blog

A way to practice using a Rust backend and Vue frontend.  It will run a Rocket server and visiting "/" will serve a Vue app as the UI.

It will be a simple application where the user can add blog posts and view the exisitng blog posts.

The database will be done in sqlite for simplicity, but future apps are intended to use others like Postgresql and Redis
