Basic plan steps

- set up a Rust back end using Rocket that can be accessed using curl commands

    - added rocket create
    - 

- give it a basic ability to serve a Vue-based front end starting page

- add a Vue form that enables writing a blog post with title, blog text, perhaps category selection

- make the form submit a post request to the back end

- create back end endpoint that accepts the post request with JSON and stores it as entry into sqlite database

- make an endpoint that retrieves existing blog posts titles to be shown as a list of clickable titles in the frontend

- when a title is clicked on, open the specific blog post and show in a template for reading the post contents
